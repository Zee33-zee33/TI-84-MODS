# Celestial Navigation

## Finding Direction Using the Sun

### Northern Hemisphere
- **Morning**: Sun rises in the east
- **Noon**: Sun is due south (highest point)
- **Evening**: Sun sets in the west

### Shadow Stick Method
1. Place a straight stick vertically in the ground
2. Mark the tip of the shadow
3. Wait 15-20 minutes
4. Mark the new shadow tip
5. Draw a line between the two marks (this runs East-West)
6. First mark is West, second mark is East

## Finding Direction Using Stars

### North Star (Polaris) - Northern Hemisphere
1. Locate the Big Dipper constellation
2. Find the two stars forming the outer edge of the "cup"
3. Draw an imaginary line through these stars
4. Extend it about 5 times the distance
5. The bright star you reach is Polaris (North Star)
6. Polaris indicates true north

### Southern Cross - Southern Hemisphere
1. Locate the Southern Cross constellation
2. Draw an imaginary line through the long axis
3. Extend it 4.5 times the length of the cross
4. Point to the horizon - this is approximately south

## Moon Navigation

### Crescent Moon
- If the crescent moon is seen in the evening:
  - Points toward the west
- If seen in the morning:
  - Points toward the east

## Tips

- Clear weather is essential for celestial navigation
- Learn major constellations before you need them
- Sun's exact position varies by season and latitude
- Always verify with multiple methods when possible
