# Map Reading

## Understanding Topographic Maps

### Key Elements

#### Contour Lines
- **Contour Lines** - Connect points of equal elevation
- **Contour Interval** - Vertical distance between lines
- **Index Contours** - Darker lines labeled with elevation
- Closer lines = steeper terrain
- Wider spacing = gentler slopes

#### Map Symbols
- **Blue** - Water features (lakes, rivers, streams)
- **Green** - Vegetation (forests, orchards)
- **Brown** - Contour lines and elevation
- **Black** - Man-made features (roads, buildings, trails)
- **Red** - Major roads and urban areas

### Map Scale

Common scales:
- **1:24,000** - 1 inch = 2,000 feet (detailed)
- **1:100,000** - 1 inch = 1.6 miles (overview)

Calculate distance:
1. Measure map distance with ruler
2. Multiply by scale factor
3. Account for elevation changes (add 10-15% for hilly terrain)

## Orienting a Map

### Using a Compass
1. Place compass on map
2. Align compass edge with map's north-south grid lines
3. Rotate map and compass together until magnetic needle points north
4. Map is now oriented to the terrain

### Using Terrain Features
1. Identify visible landmarks
2. Locate them on the map
3. Rotate map until features align with their real-world positions

## Reading Terrain

### Recognizing Features
- **Ridge** - Contour lines form a "U" pointing downhill
- **Valley** - Contour lines form a "V" pointing uphill
- **Peak** - Concentric circles with highest elevation in center
- **Saddle** - Low point between two peaks

## Route Planning

1. **Identify start and end points**
2. **Mark waypoints** - Key decision points along route
3. **Calculate distance** - Use map scale
4. **Estimate time** - Factor in elevation gain/loss
5. **Identify escape routes** - Bailout options if needed
6. **Note water sources** - Plan refill points

## Tips

- Keep map dry (use waterproof case or bag)
- Update position frequently
- Mark your route with pencil
- Practice in familiar areas first
- Carry a backup map or GPS device
