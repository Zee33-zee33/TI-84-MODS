# Compass Navigation

## Understanding Your Compass

### Basic Components
- **Magnetic Needle** - Points to magnetic north
- **Baseplate** - Transparent plate for map work
- **Rotating Bezel** - Degree markings (0-360°)
- **Direction of Travel Arrow** - Points where you want to go
- **Orienting Arrow** - Red arrow inside the housing

## Taking a Bearing

1. Point the direction of travel arrow at your target
2. Rotate the bezel until the orienting arrow aligns with the magnetic needle
3. Read the bearing at the index line (0-360°)

## Following a Bearing

1. Set your desired bearing on the compass
2. Hold the compass level and turn your body until the magnetic needle aligns with the orienting arrow
3. Follow the direction of travel arrow

## Declination

- **Magnetic Declination** - The difference between true north and magnetic north
- Varies by location and changes over time
- East declination: Subtract from map bearing
- West declination: Add to map bearing

## Tips

- Keep metal objects away from compass (at least 10 feet)
- Practice in familiar areas first
- Cross-check with other navigation methods
- Update declination settings when traveling to new regions
