# Food Foraging and Procurement

## Priority Note

**Food is the LAST survival priority.** Focus on shelter, fire, and water first.
- Humans can survive 3+ weeks without food
- Energy spent hunting may exceed calories gained
- Unsafe food can cause illness, worsening your situation

## Universal Edibility Test

**ONLY use when absolutely necessary and no other options exist.**

1. **Test one plant part at a time** (leaf, stem, root differ)
2. **Separate the plant** - Fast for 8 hours
3. **Skin test** - Rub plant on inner elbow, wait 15 minutes for reaction
4. **Lip test** - Touch to lips, wait 3 minutes for burning/tingling
5. **Tongue test** - Touch to tongue, wait 15 minutes
6. **Chew test** - Chew small amount, don't swallow, wait 15 minutes
7. **Swallow test** - Swallow small amount, wait 5 hours
8. **Eat small portion** - Wait 8 hours, monitor for illness
9. **If no reaction** - Eat larger portion

**Never test:**
- Plants with milky or discolored sap
- Plants with beans, bulbs, or seeds inside pods
- Plants with bitter or soapy taste
- Plants with thorns, spines, or fine hairs
- Plants with three-leafed growth pattern (poison ivy/oak)
- Mushrooms (too risky without expert knowledge)

## Commonly Safe Wild Edibles

### Plants (Verify with field guide!)

**Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale)**
- Entire plant edible
- Leaves best when young
- Roots can be roasted
- Yellow flowers edible

**Cattail (Typha species)**
- Roots, shoots, and pollen edible
- Starch-rich rhizomes
- Young shoots taste like cucumber
- Available year-round

**Clover (Trifolium species)**
- Leaves and flowers edible
- High in protein
- Easy to identify
- Avoid red clover if on blood thinners

**Plantain (Plantago species)**
- Young leaves best (raw or cooked)
- Seeds edible
- Not the banana-like plantain
- Common in lawns and trails

**Pine (Pinus species)**
- Needles for tea (vitamin C)
- Inner bark edible (cambium layer)
- Seeds (pine nuts) in some species
- Avoid yew and Norfolk Island pine (toxic)

**Acorns (Quercus species)**
- Must leach tannins first
- Boil in multiple water changes
- High in calories and fat
- Time-consuming but nutritious

### Berries (Verify before eating!)

**Generally Safe:**
- Blueberries (blue, multiple seeds)
- Blackberries (black, multi-lobed)
- Raspberries (red/black, hollow core)
- Strawberries (red, seeds on outside)
- Elderberries (dark purple, cooked only)

**Avoid:**
- White berries (almost always poisonous)
- Yellow berries (50% poisonous)
- Unknown red berries (many toxic varieties)
- Single berries on a stem (often toxic)

## Insects (High Protein)

**Generally Safe When Cooked:**
- Grasshoppers and crickets
- Grubs and larvae
- Ants (remove head first)
- Termites
- Earthworms (purge dirt first)

**Avoid:**
- Brightly colored insects
- Hairy or spiny insects
- Insects with strong odors
- Disease-carrying insects (flies, mosquitoes)
- Spiders and centipedes

**Preparation:**
- Cook thoroughly
- Remove wings, legs, head
- Roast over fire or boil

## Fishing

### Improvised Methods

**Hand Line**
- Use any cordage
- Bend safety pin or wire for hook
- Bait with insects, worms, small fish
- Fish at dawn/dusk

**Spearing**
- Sharpen stick or lash knife to pole
- Look in shallow, clear water
- Aim below the fish (refraction)
- Quick, decisive jab

**Traps**
- Build stone weir in stream
- Fish swim in, can't find way out
- Check morning and evening

## Small Game Trapping

### Simple Snare

**Components:**
- Wire or strong cordage
- Trigger mechanism
- Anchoring stake

**Placement:**
- On animal trails
- Near dens or burrows
- Where animals must pass (between obstacles)

**Size:**
- Rabbit: 3-4 inch diameter loop
- Squirrel: 2-3 inch diameter loop
- Set at head height for target animal

### Legal and Ethical Note

- Check local regulations before setting traps
- Only use in true survival situations
- Check traps frequently
- Minimize animal suffering

## Food Preparation

### Cooking Methods

**Boiling**
- Safest method
- Preserves nutrients
- Requires container

**Roasting**
- Direct heat over fire
- Good for meat
- Can dry out food

**Rock Boiling**
- Heat rocks in fire
- Drop in water-filled container
- Cooks without direct flame

### Food Safety

- Cook all meat thoroughly
- Internal temp 165Â°F minimum
- Avoid spoiled food (bad smell, discoloration, slime)
- Eat cooked food within hours in warm weather
- When in doubt, throw it out

## Nutrition Priorities

**Calories:**
- Fats: 9 calories per gram (nuts, fish, animal fat)
- Carbs: 4 calories per gram (roots, seeds, berries)
- Protein: 4 calories per gram (meat, insects, fish)

**Balance:**
- Don't eat only protein (rabbit starvation)
- Need fats and carbs for energy
- Vary diet when possible

## Conservation and Ethics

- Take only what you need
- Don't deplete one area
- Protect plant roots for regrowth
- Respect wildlife and habitat
- Learn before you need it (take classes)

## Warning Signs of Poisoning

- Nausea or vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Dizziness or confusion
- Difficulty breathing
- Rapid heartbeat
- Sweating or chills

**Action:** Stop eating immediately, induce vomiting if recently consumed, drink water, seek medical help.

## Tips

- Carry field guide for your region
- Practice identification in safe conditions
- Start with 100% certain edibles
- Never eat anything you can't positively identify
- Quantity doesn't equal safety (toxic plants can be abundant)
- Focus on high-calorie foods if you must forage
- Remember: Starvation takes weeks, poisoning can kill in hours
