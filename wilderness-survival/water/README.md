# Water Sourcing and Purification

## Importance of Water

- Human body is 60% water
- Can survive ~3 days without water
- Dehydration severely impairs judgment and physical ability
- Daily needs: 2-4 liters (more in hot/active conditions)

## Finding Water Sources

### Reliable Sources

**Flowing Water**
- Streams and rivers
- Springs
- Better than stagnant water
- Still requires purification

**Rainwater**
- Collect directly in clean containers
- Use tarps or ponchos as collectors
- One of the safest sources
- Still purify if possible

**Morning Dew**
- Tie cloth around ankles
- Walk through grass at dawn
- Wring out into container
- Labor-intensive but effective

### Signs of Water

- Following animal trails (often lead to water)
- Birds flying in straight lines (morning/evening)
- Insects (swarms near water)
- Lush vegetation
- Valley bottoms
- Rock crevices and depressions

### Questionable Sources

**Stagnant Water**
- Ponds and lakes
- Always purify
- Last resort if no flowing water

**Avoid:**
- Water with algae blooms
- Strong chemical smell
- Dead animals nearby
- Bright colors or oily sheen
- Murky or cloudy water (filter first if necessary)

## Water Collection Methods

### Solar Still

1. Dig hole 3 feet wide, 2 feet deep
2. Place container in center
3. Cover with clear plastic
4. Weight center over container
5. Seal edges with dirt
6. Condensation drips into container

Yields: ~1 liter per day

### Transpiration Bag

1. Place clear plastic bag over leafy branch
2. Seal tightly at base
3. Weight one corner
4. Water collects in corner
5. Don't damage the plant

Yields: ~1 liter per day per bag

### Vegetation Collection

- Tie cloth around green vegetation
- Wring moisture into container
- Bamboo often contains water in segments

## Water Purification Methods

### Boiling (Most Reliable)

- Bring to rolling boil
- Maintain for 1 minute (add 1 minute per 1,000 ft elevation)
- At 6,500+ feet: boil for 3 minutes
- Let cool before drinking
- Kills all pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites)

### Chemical Treatment

**Iodine Tablets**
- 2 tablets per liter
- Wait 30 minutes
- Wait 60 minutes if water is cold or cloudy
- Leaves slight taste
- Not for pregnant women or long-term use

**Chlorine Dioxide**
- Follow package directions
- Usually 30-60 minute wait
- Effective against most pathogens
- No taste

**Household Bleach (Emergency)**
- 2 drops per liter (5.25% sodium hypochlorite)
- 4 drops if cloudy
- Wait 30 minutes
- Should smell slightly of chlorine
- Don't use scented or color-safe bleach

### Filtration

**Commercial Filters**
- Remove bacteria and parasites
- Most don't remove viruses
- Follow manufacturer instructions
- Requires regular maintenance

**Improvised Filter**

Layers (top to bottom):
1. Cloth or coffee filter
2. Sand (fine)
3. Crushed charcoal
4. Sand (coarse)
5. Gravel

Note: Removes particles and some contaminants but **NOT** pathogens. Must still purify filtered water.

### UV Light

- Portable UV purifiers available
- Expose water to UV for specified time
- Only works with clear water
- Battery dependent

## Combination Approach

**Best Practice:**
1. Filter to remove particles
2. Boil or treat chemically
3. Double purification for questionable sources

## Water Storage

- Use food-grade containers
- Clean regularly
- Keep out of direct sunlight
- Seal tightly to prevent contamination
- Rotate stored water every 6 months

## Dehydration Warning Signs

**Early:**
- Thirst
- Dry mouth
- Dark urine
- Fatigue

**Severe:**
- Dizziness
- Rapid heartbeat
- Confusion
- No urination
- Extreme thirst

**Action:** Drink water immediately, seek medical help if severe.

## Tips

- Don't wait until desperate to find water
- Carry water when possible
- Ration sweat, not water (rest during heat)
- Never drink seawater or urine
- Avoid alcohol and caffeine (dehydrating)
- Clear urine = well hydrated
- Conserve energy to conserve water needs
