# Shelter Building

## Shelter Selection Criteria

### Priority Factors
1. **Protection from weather** - Wind, rain, snow, sun
2. **Insulation** - Ground and air temperature
3. **Proximity to resources** - Water, firewood, materials
4. **Safety** - Avoid hazards (dead trees, flood zones, animal dens)

## Natural Shelters

### Caves and Rock Overhangs
- **Advantages**: Ready-made, solid protection
- **Disadvantages**: May be damp, occupied by animals
- **Check for**: Animal signs, stability, ventilation

### Fallen Trees
- **Lean-to shelter**: Use fallen tree as ridgepole
- **Add branches** at 45° angle against the trunk
- **Cover** with leaves, bark, or debris for insulation

## Constructed Shelters

### Debris Hut
**Best for**: Solo survival in cold conditions

1. Create ridgepole 8-10 feet long
2. Prop one end 3-4 feet high
3. Build ribbing along both sides
4. Cover with debris (leaves, bark, grass) - at least 2-3 feet thick
5. Line interior with dry leaves

### Lean-To
**Best for**: Quick shelter near fire

1. Find or create a horizontal support
2. Lean branches at 45° angle
3. Cover with bark, leaves, or tarp
4. Build reflector fire in front for warmth

### A-Frame Shelter
**Best for**: Extended stays, better protection

1. Create ridgepole between two trees or supports
2. Lean branches on both sides forming an "A"
3. Cover with bark, leaves, or debris
4. Create thick layer for weatherproofing

### Tarp Shelters

**A-Frame Tarp**
- Tie ridgeline between trees
- Drape tarp over line
- Stake out corners at 45° angles

**Lean-To Tarp**
- Tie one edge high (7-8 feet)
- Stake opposite edge to ground
- Creates coverage from rain and wind

## Ground Insulation

**Critical in cold weather:**
- Never sleep directly on ground
- Use pine boughs, leaves, or grass
- Create 6-8 inch thick layer
- Replace if it becomes compressed

## Location Guidelines

### Good Locations
- Slightly elevated (drainage)
- Near water (but not too close)
- Near firewood and materials
- Protected from wind
- Morning sun exposure

### Avoid
- Valley bottoms (cold air sinks)
- Dry riverbeds (flash flood risk)
- Under dead trees or loose rocks
- Animal trails or dens
- Insect nesting areas

## Tips

- Build shelter before dark
- Make shelter only as large as needed (easier to heat)
- Test stability before committing
- Always have ventilation (prevent CO2 buildup)
- Insulate from ground first, then worry about overhead
