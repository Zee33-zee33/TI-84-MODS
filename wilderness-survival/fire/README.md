# Fire Starting

## Fire Triangle

Fire requires three elements:
1. **Heat** - Ignition source
2. **Fuel** - Material to burn
3. **Oxygen** - Air flow

Remove any one element and fire goes out.

## Fire Preparation

### Location
- Clear 10-foot diameter area down to mineral soil
- Shield from wind (but allow airflow)
- Away from overhanging branches
- Near shelter (but safe distance)
- Consider smoke direction

### Fire Lay Types

**Teepee**
- Lean kindling in cone shape
- Good for quick heat
- Burns fast, needs frequent feeding

**Log Cabin**
- Stack wood in square pattern
- Good for cooking fires
- Burns evenly and longer

**Lean-To**
- Large log as windbreak
- Lean kindling against it
- Good in windy conditions

**Star Fire**
- Logs arranged like wheel spokes
- Push logs in as they burn
- Conserves fuel

## Fuel Categories

### Tinder (catches spark/flame easily)
- Dry grass
- Birch bark
- Cedar bark
- Pine needles
- Char cloth
- Cotton balls with petroleum jelly
- Dryer lint

### Kindling (finger to thumb thickness)
- Small dry twigs
- Split wood
- Fatwood (resinous pine)
- Pencil-sized sticks

### Fuel Wood (larger than kindling)
- Wrist-sized branches
- Split logs
- Dead standing wood (best - dries from top down)

**Avoid:**
- Green wood (too much moisture)
- Rotten wood (poor fuel)
- Wood from ground (too wet)

## Ignition Methods

### Modern Methods

**Matches**
- Waterproof matches preferred
- Store in waterproof container
- Strike away from wind

**Lighter**
- Reliable in most conditions
- Can fail when wet or cold
- Carry backup

### Primitive Methods

**Friction Fire - Bow Drill**

Components:
- Bow: Curved stick with cordage
- Drill: Straight hardwood spindle
- Fireboard: Flat softwood base
- Handhold: Socket to apply pressure

Steps:
1. Cut notch in fireboard
2. Create dust pile beneath notch
3. Spin drill with bow motion
4. Dust becomes ember
5. Transfer ember to tinder bundle

**Flint and Steel**
1. Strike steel against flint at angle
2. Sparks fall onto char cloth or tinder
3. Blow gently to ignite
4. Transfer to tinder bundle

**Magnifying Glass (Solar)**
- Focus sunlight on tinder
- Create smallest point of light
- Hold steady until smoke appears
- Blow gently to flame

## Fire Starting Steps

1. **Gather materials** - Collect 3x more than you think you need
2. **Prepare tinder bundle** - Nest of fine, dry material
3. **Arrange kindling** - Have ready to add
4. **Create ignition** - Spark, flame, or ember
5. **Transfer to tinder** - Blow gently to ignite
6. **Add kindling gradually** - Don't smother
7. **Build to fuel wood** - Once established

## Fire Maintenance

- Feed fire regularly
- Don't overload (smothers flame)
- Keep wood dry
- Maintain airflow
- Have water ready for emergencies

## Fire in Wet Conditions

- Collect standing dead wood
- Split wood to expose dry interior
- Use knife to create feather sticks
- Gather extra tinder
- Create rain cover over fire area
- Build larger initial fire

## Fire Safety

- Never leave fire unattended
- Clear surrounding area of flammables
- Keep water or dirt nearby
- Fully extinguish before leaving
- Stir ashes and drown with water
- Feel for heat - should be cold to touch

## Extinguishing Fire

1. Spread out coals
2. Drown with water
3. Stir ashes
4. Add more water
5. Check for heat
6. Repeat until completely cold
